EMB_GARCH - Volatility Modeling on Emerging Market Bonds

This project analyzes and forecasts the volatility of the iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) using advanced time-series models. The goal is to evaluate model performance in capturing volatility clustering, regime shifts, and forecast accuracy, through a combination of traditional econometrics and probabilistic modeling.

Models Implemented:

GARCH family models
GARCH(1,1), IGARCH
GARCH-t(1,2): selected as best performing model (lowest MAE/RMSE)
EGARCH for asymmetric effects (benchmark)
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Gaussian HMM with 2 and 3 latent regimes
Identifies periods of high vs low volatility based on return distributions
Regime persistence and transition matrix analysis included
Rolling Forecast Framework
1-day, 5-day, 10-day forecasts
Out-of-sample evaluation with realized volatility comparison

Data:
Primary asset: EMB ETF (2021–2024), fetched via yfinance
Additional macro indices for exploratory analysis:
^VIX (implied volatility)
^TNX (10-year Treasury yield)
DX-Y.NYB (USD index)
SPY (S&P 500)
HYG, LQD (corporate bond ETFs)
GLD (gold)

Findings:
GARCH-t(1,2) with Student’s t-distributed residuals outperformed all other specifications.
EGARCH did not improve results in this setting despite modeling asymmetries.
HMMs successfully detected regime switches, with high persistence in low-volatility states.
Rolling correlations with market indices (e.g., VIX, TNX) revealed weak and unstable linear relationships, highlighting the need for regime-based or nonlinear approaches.

Structure:

utils/: helper functions for plotting, rolling metrics, volatility computation
data/: holdings data and downloadable ETF metadata
README.md: project overview and documentation

Limitations and Future Work:
HMM assumes Gaussian emissions – future work could extend to Bayesian HMMs with t-distributions.
Only univariate models are tested – DCC-GARCH or multivariate HMMs could improve portfolio-level risk modeling.
Incorporating macro factors or sentiment data may enhance explanatory power.
Deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs) could be considered for non-linear sequential modeling, with sufficient data and training capacity.
